Test Plan

1) All the test scenarios are laid out in the specs/searchemployee.e2e.js. Please see that
2) Would ask to include some more points in the acceptance critera
    a) for the search box is there any default placeholder text present?
    b) after the search is complete does the text remain in the search box or cleared?
    c) is there any autocomplete feature?
    d) is there a submit button or does the search run as text is entered?
